### Resume information extraction (Hugging Face NER)

A small project that fine-tunes a token-classification model (BERT) to extract structured work-experience fields from unstructured resume text. The notebook demonstrates the full pipeline — data cleaning, GPT-based annotation, span-tag formatting, model fine-tuning, inference and JSON output generation.
